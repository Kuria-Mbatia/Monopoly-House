# Monopoly Property Management System

This serves as a baseline for learning how to implement a property management system for Monopoly in C++, allowing players to purchase properties, build houses/hotels, and manage ownership. The system includes comprehensive testing for all property-related operations, what is not included is the player files as that is a seperate instance that can be built upon but this is a support class for property management.

## Components

### House.h
The header file defines the House class interface with:
- Property attributes (name, price, rent, owner)
- Building management (houses and hotels)
- Ownership management
- Status tracking

Key features:
- Property purchase and transfer methods
- House/hotel addition and removal
- Rent calculation based on development
- Property status reporting

### House.cpp
Implementation file containing all the House class method definitions needed:
- Constructor initialization
- Building management logic
- Ownership transfer validation
- Rent calculation algorithms
- Property status generation

### Test.cpp
Comprehensive test suite demonstrating:
- Property creation and initialization
- Purchase and ownership management
- Development (houses/hotels)
- Edge cases valid/invalid operations
- Player portfolio tracking

## Test Cases

1. **Initial Property Status**
   - Verifies proper property initialization
   - Checks initial values and ownership status

2. **Basic Operations and Ownership**
   - Tests property purchases
   - Demonstrates house building
   - Shows rent calculations at different development levels

3. **Player Portfolios**
   - Tracks properties owned by each player
   - Shows total houses built
   - Calculates total collectible rent

4. **Hotel Operations**
   - Tests hotel addition requirements
   - Verifies hotel-related restrictions
   - Demonstrates rent changes with hotels

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Attempts to exceed house limits
   - Tests invalid house removal
   - Checks hotel addition prerequisites

6. **Ownership Transfers**
   - Tests valid/invalid property transfers
   - Verifies ownership restrictions
   - Updates player portfolios

7. **Final Status**
   - Shows final property conditions
   - Displays final player portfolios

8. **Property Development**
   - Progressive development
   - Gives rent increases as a player develops a property

## Compilation and Running

### Using G++
```bash
# Compiling the program, assuming that you have g++
g++ -std=c++11 Test.cpp House.cpp -o monopoly

# Running the program, because a few individuals asked, the ./monopoly is the file geenrated after running the "Compile the Program step"
# ./monoploy is the executable generated by the compiler to run the code, use it to run the program
./monopoly
```

### Using GCC
```bash
# Compiling the program, assuming that you have gcc
gcc -std=c++11 Test.cpp House.cpp -o monopoly -lstdc++

# Running the program, because a few individuals asked, the ./monopoly is the file geenrated after running the "Compile the Program step"
# ./monoploy is the executable generated by the compiler to run the code, use it to run the program
./monopoly
```

## Usage
The test program automatically runs through all test cases, feel free to make your own! Player names can be modified at the start of main():
```cpp
const std::string player1 = "Turia";
const std::string player2 = "Tyler";
const std::string player3 = "Charlie";
```

## Requirements
- C++11 or later, this was because I originally was going to use tuples but those don't compile properly except for later C versions
- GCC or G++ compiler

## Output overview
The program gives test output information for:
- Property status changes
- Development progress
- Ownership transfers
- Player portfolio updates
- Test case results

## Note
This is a testing framework for the property management system. Property values and rent calculations can be modified in the property constructors to match specific Monopoly editions!
There's also other methods that you can create such as foreclosure methods that will swap a property to be owned by the bank
*Should probably impliment that where all properties by default are owned by the bank instead of no one so that logging of ownership is not null at the inception
